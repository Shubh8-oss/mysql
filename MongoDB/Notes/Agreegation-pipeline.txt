Aggregation Pipeline : It is a powerful tool in mongodb for processing, retriveing and transforming the data.
A Pipeline consists of multiple stages which are connected and one stage's output will be come another stage input .
we use agreegate  function to achieve this
  db.collectionName.aggregate([pipeline])

  stages: Some common stages used in aggregate are
  1.$match: filters the documents based on a condition
  2.$project: reshapes the document by adding, removing or renaming fields
  3.$sort: sort the documents based on a specific field
  4.$limit:  limits the documents with a number to the next stage
  5.$skip : skips the documets with a number to the next stage
  6.$group : groups the documents based on a specific field
  7. $lookup : used to combine with another collection documents
  8. $unwind: separates a listed field along with document values
