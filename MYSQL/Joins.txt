Joins: Joins are used to combine multiple tables such that the result of the query retrieved from both the tables. There are different types of Joins
   i. inner Join
   ii. Left Join
   iii. right Join
   iv. Full Outer Join
   v. cross Join
   vi. Self Join

i. Inner Join : Inner Join is used to retrieve common data between the tables

select t1.columnName,t2.columnName
from table1 as t1
inner Join
table2 as t2
ON condition



select Customers.first_name,Customers.last_name,Shippings.status
from Customers
inner Join
Shippings
ON Customers.customer_id=Shippings.customer

ii. left JOIN :  left join is used to retieve left table complete results along with common data
select t1.columnName,t2.columnName
from table1 as t1
left Join
table2 as t2
ON condition

select t1.tname, t2.class_name
from staff as t1
left join
classes as t2
on t1.tid=t2.classTeacherId

Right Join:   Right Join is used to retrieve the data which is completely from right table and common data from left table

select t1.columnName,t2.columnName
from table1 as t1
right Join
table2 as t2
ON condition

Full Outer Join: It is union of both tables where result is all from left table and all from right table
In MYSQL, Full outer Join is not directly Possible. Instead we can combine left join and right join using "union" command


tas1: print cutomer names along with no of items they bought

select t1.first_name,t1.last_name,count(t2.item)
from Customers as t1
left join
Orders as t2
ON t1.customer_id= t2.customer_id
group by t2.item
